The area label repeats the pinned main tree for reporter compatibility.

Lowering, main: 2/79; root-order artifacts: 3.

For artifact roots, lowering requires attempted units in every program source, no entry-census finding in the program, and the whole-program passes of every unit measured. No native output is claimed.

Area reuses main's measurement, not a second measurement. main/ was copied to area/ before reporting and gzip; both labels use main-adapted. See compiler-mode.json measurement_sources.

Elapsed: 105m 55s.
