# TypeScript upstream bug ledger

Fork fixes stay separate from soundness adaptations. Kirk decides when to file
these drafted issues. Nothing in this ledger has been sent upstream.

## 1. Empty single-quoted triple-slash pragma argument throws

Status: fixed in our fork by adaptation 46; draft issue, not filed.
Upstream: TypeScript 6.0.3, commit 050880ce59e30b356b686bd3144efe24f875ebc8.
Location: src/compiler/parser.ts:10731 selects the argument using
`matchResult[2] || matchResult[3]`; parser.ts:10737 reads `value.length` and throws.
The quote-alternative matcher is constructed at parser.ts:10707.

Node counterexample input: `/// <reference path='' />`.
Before: `createSourceFile` throws
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in
extractPragmas. The successful match has group 2 equal to `""` and group 3
undefined, so truthy selection discards the participating empty capture.
After: parsing succeeds, referencedFiles has one entry whose fileName is `""`
and whose capture span has length 0. Nonempty single/double quotes and empty
double quotes retain their previous results.

Our patch: stage3/adapt/46-fix-pragma-empty-argument/adapt.cjs changes only the
operator in adaptation 45's checked boundary:

```diff
- const value = (matchResult[2] || matchResult[3])!;
+ const value = (matchResult[2] ?? matchResult[3])!;
```

Groups 2 and 3 are alternative quote branches and exactly one participates in
every successful match. Either participating capture may be empty. Nullish
selection keeps the empty string, and the entire result is therefore present.
Neither individual capture is asserted mandatory.

### Draft GitHub issue

Title: Empty single-quoted reference path crashes createSourceFile in TypeScript 6.0.3

Version: TypeScript 6.0.3, reproduced on Node 24.19.0.

Minimal reproduction:

```sh
mkdir tsc-empty-reference-repro
cd tsc-empty-reference-repro
npm install --no-audit --no-fund typescript@6.0.3
```

Save this as repro.cjs and run `node repro.cjs`:

```js
const ts = require("typescript");
const source = ts.createSourceFile("empty.ts", "/// <reference path='' />", ts.ScriptTarget.Latest);
console.log(JSON.stringify(source.referencedFiles.map(file => file.fileName)));
console.log(source.referencedFiles[0].end - source.referencedFiles[0].pos);
```

Expected: the parser completes and represents the empty value consistently
with a double-quoted empty reference path, printing:

```text
[""]
0
```

Actual: the parser throws
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in
extractPragmas. The equivalent `/// <reference path="" />` parses successfully.

Suggested upstream change: use `matchResult[2] ?? matchResult[3]` when choosing
between the single-quoted and double-quoted argument captures. The `!` in our
fork patch belongs to our sounder regex declarations; it is not needed in
upstream's standard string-valued capture declarations.
